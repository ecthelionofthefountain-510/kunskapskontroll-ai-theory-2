Oromë
Oromë (Quenya: [ˈorome] "Horn-blower"), also known as Aldaron (Quenya: "Lord of Forests"), Araw (Sindarin), and Arǭmēz, was an Ainu, one of the Aratar and the Vala responsible for the hunt. He was the brother of Nessa and husband of Vána.[2]

Biography

During the Years of the Trees, after most of the Valar had withdrawn completely from Middle-earth and hidden themselves in Aman, Oromë still hunted in the forests of Middle-earth on occasion. Thus, it was he who discovered the Elves when they first awoke at Cuiviénen and named them the Eldar. [3] Thereafter, he remained close in friendship with them.

A powerful huntsman, he was active in the struggles against Morgoth. He had a great horn called the Valaróma and a great steed named Nahar.[2] Huan, a Hound from Valinor, once belonged to him but was later given to Celegorm, a son of Fëanor.[4]

In legend, Oromë is said to have first created the Rainbow or "Bridge of Heaven" using golden threads of Vána's hair, during the Hiding of Valinor.[5]

Character
Oromë is described as a mighty lord and a great huntsman, as he would often train his folk and beasts in pursuit of evil creatures. He loved the lands of Middle-earth and was initially unwilling to leave it. He contrasts with the Vala Tulkas in demeanor; whereas Tulkas laughs in sports, Oromë is said to be dreadful in anger.[2]

Maiar of Oromë
Tilion, the Maia who guided the Moon, was one of his Maiar in Valinor.
Alatar and Pallando, the last two of the five wizards, were Maiar sent by Oromë to Middle-earth. What became of them is not known, although apparently they journeyed into the east with Saruman, but did not return.
In other versions
In earlier versions of the legendarium Aulë and Yavanna were the parents of Oromë and Nessa. Furthermore, Oromë and his wife Vána were once envisioned to have had a daughter named Nielíqui.[6]

Etymology

Oromë means "Horn-blowing" or "Sound of horns",[7] deriving from the Valarin name Arômêz.[8]

Araw is the Sindarin translation of Oromë.[8] The Sindar additionally referred to him as Tauron, which means "Lord of the Forests" and "The Forester."[7] It is possible that the name comes from Sindarin taur ("forest") or Quenya taure ("great wood").[9]

Other names
In the Old English translation of tales by Eriol, Oromë is called Wadfrea ("The Huntinglord"), Huntena frea ("Lord of Hunters"), and Wealdafrea ("Lord of Forests").[10] Among the Rohirrim and other Northmen, he was also sometimes called Béma (Old English, originally Béaming; translating Tauron "forest-lord").[11]
